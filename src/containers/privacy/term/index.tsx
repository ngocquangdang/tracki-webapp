          OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.
          Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury,

          very limited review by courts. Please visit www.adr.org for more

            Commencing Arbitration.
          </span>{' '}
          A party seeking arbitration must first send to the other, by certified
          mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the
          absence of a mailing address provided by you to THE COMPANY, to you
          via any other method available to THE COMPANY, including via e-mail.
          The Notice to THE COMPANY should be addressed to Tracki, Inc., 450
          Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10123, Attn: Chief Executive Officer (the
          “Address”). The Notice must (A) describe the nature and basis of the
          claim or dispute; and (B) set forth the specific relief sought (the
          “Demand”). If the claim is not resolved within 30 days after the
          Notice is received, then you or THE COMPANY may commence an
          arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small
          claims court. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN
          ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL
          ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER
          RELATED DISPUTES (THE “Rules”), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. The
          Rules and AAA forms are available at www.adr.org. If you are required
          to pay a filing fee to commence arbitration against THE COMPANY, then
          THE COMPANY will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of
          the filing fee upon THE COMPANY’s receipt of Notice at the Address
          that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt for the
          filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or
          was filed in bad faith.

          County, New York, will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified
          herein. You and THE COMPANY agree to comply with the following rules,
          which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and
          reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (A) the arbitration will
          be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written
          submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating
          the arbitration; (B) the arbitration will not require any personal
          appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually
          agreed in writing by the parties; and (C) any judgment on the award
          rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent

          PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE

          her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is
          appointed. The arbitrator may extend this deadline by 30 days in the

          The award will be in writing and will include a statement setting
          forth the reasons for the claim’s disposition. The arbitrator will
          apply New York state law during the arbitration. You agree that these
